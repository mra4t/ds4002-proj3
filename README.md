### Installing / Building the Code
To install the code, download the RMD file in the SRC folder. Open this in RStudio and run the code. All of the libraries that need to be installed are already included at the top of the file, so the code solely needs to be ran to successfully build the code. 

### Code Usage
This code can be used to understand the different components of a movie poster that may contribute to the movie's success.
